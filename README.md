Hello World!
This is my journey into programming and coding.
I have NO experience.
I am getting experience through reading online tutorials, books and forums.
I have a goal, to create a cross platform feedback system that can be used by teachers to efficently provide valuable feedback to their students.
I originally got the idea after using a clipboard manager called "DItto" for the last two years. I have run it off a flashdrive at work (on windows) but I use Linux at home and can't find a resonable compromise. I know that ditto is an advanced piece of software and eventually I would like to learn to make something feature rich like it, but I am taking small steps right now.

Here is what I am aiming for:
A folder structure for a teachers terms (trimesters or semesters)
A subfolder structure for units
Plain text documents for assignments that can contain up to 10 lines (would like it to be more later
Software that walks the user through the setup
Ability to create new assignments and create comments on specific lines in document (0-9)
Ability to modify comments in assigments based on their line number (0-9)

Stretch goals:
Use python to interface with a database to store information rather than text documents
Create a user interface similar to that of ditto
Package app using a universal wrapper like a snap or flatpack or  appimage.

License: This is new to me. . . I would like this to be creative commons so that everyone can benefit from it but not profit off of it. I want it to be free in all senses of the word (beer and speech). So if someone could explain how to properly do this, that would be great!
